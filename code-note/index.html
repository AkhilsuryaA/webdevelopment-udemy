    <h4>Html & Boilerplate</h4>
    <p>
        an html boiler plate is a template of code that we can reuse.
        <br><br>
        'Doctype html is defined at top of html page that is html5'
        <br><br>
        'meta tag charset utf-8'
        <br> <br>
        all the text in webpage is encoded with unicode -> contains all available character encodes
        <br><br>
        meta tags give information about how to render or display content it can also provide information to search
        engine
        like in meta tag name descriptiona and content as its content
        <br><br>
        "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""
    </p>
    <h4>Structure</h4>
    <em>Emphasis <strong>this <a href="#">thing</a> </strong></em>
    <p>
        html content should always be inside a "body" tag
    </p>
    <p>
        The indent helps us in structure code in html, very helpful in reading & understanding code.
    </p>
    <p>
        "em" tag helps to emphasis a text inside it, we can italise text using it, whrn used with anchor tags it
        underlines text
        avoid "i" tag and "b"
        use "em" and "strong" instead
    </p>
    <h4>List</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>one</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
    </ul>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>one</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Two kind of lists ordered and unordered
        "ol" for ordered "ul" for unordered
        ul gives dot as prefix
        ol can give numbers, letters, roman as prefix. type attribute is used to do that
        "li" used in both for listing out items
    </p>
    <h4>Image</h4>
    <img height='100' width="175"
        src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/orange-3d-number-200-isolated-600w-2039542001.jpg"
        alt="Sample Image" />
    <p>
        "img" tag is used for img, its a self closing tag
        attricbute "src" is used to display image
        it can be a link or a image from local source
        "alt" attribute can contain information about the img or anything you want to convey
    </p>
    <h4>Anchor Tags</h4>
    <a href="#">Test Link</a>
    <p>
        "anchor" tags are clickable elements that can contain linke to external websites and html pages inside code
        itself
        "href" attribute is used to fed links and sources
    </p>
    <h4>Table</h4>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Sl.No</th>
                <th>Name</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>John Doe</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Jane Doe</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

                <input type="text" /><br />
                <input type="submit" />
            </form>
            <p>
                we can design and structure a form without js
                "label" gives a label to the field
                form has different attributes like action , method etc
                input is a self closing tag

            <h1>
                CSS
            </h1>
            <h4>Inline CSS</h4>
            <p style="background-color: powderblue;">
                This is sample text
            </p>
            <p>
                we can style elements using inline css, css written by using style attribute on an html tag
            </p>
            <h4>Internal CSS</h4>
            <p>
                we write css code inside a style tag for a tag
                usually inside a head tag before body tag
                usually done for styling that certain page
            </p>
            <h4>External CSS</h4>
            <p>
                we write css code inside a stylesheet page used globally.
                this is the proposed method
            </p>
            <style>
                hr {
                    border-style: none;
                    border-top-style: dotted;
                    border-color: grey;
                    border-width: 5px;
                    width: 10%;
                }
            </style>
            <hr>
            <h4>CSS Selectors</h4>
            <p>
                tag,class and id are all used to select elements and select them.
                out of all these id selectors is most specific (inline comes even before that, but is not selector.)
                multiple class can be used on same element but not ids
                ids shouldn't be repeated on same page
            </p>
            <h4>FavIcons</h4>
            <p>
                Icons that prefix website title
            </p>
            <h4>div tag</h4>
            <p>
                divs are building blocks that doesnt do anything without any style or anything inside them, they allows
                us to divide the content in html
            </p>
            <h3>
                html body has default styles including a margin property, which gives margin to each side of body, which
                can be removed.
            </h3>
            <h4>
                width,height, padding,border and margin -> box modal
            </h4>
            <h4>
                display property
            </h4>
            <p>
            <div>hi block</div>
            <span> inline </span> <span> element </span>
            <br />
            <div style="display : inline-block">hi inline block</div>
            <div style="display : inline-block">hi inline block</div>
            <br />
            display has block,inline, inline-block and none properties
            block blocks everything on its level only the element has place in that row
            <br />
            inline can place elements along the line but can't change width
            <br />
            inline-block can have width and place elemnts along the line
            </p>
            <h4>
                HTML Rules
            </h4>
            <p>
                1.Content is everything, it defines all the properties height width and position default
            </p>
            <p>
                2. deafult layout order is determined by our code layout
            </p>
            <p>
                3. children sits on top of parent
            </p>
            <h4>
                CSS Positioning
            </h4>
            <p>
                Static<br>
                This is the default posotion of the html
            </p>
            <p>
                Relative<br>
                here the position is changed relative to its original position using four
                co-ordinates(top,bottom,left&right)
                <br>there will be no changes to other elements around this element.<br>Its said that the relative
                position makes the element to leave its ghost in place of its original position<br> lets say that its
                gives a margin between original positiona and new position
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Absolute<br>
                we are adding a margin to the parent element
                <br>Positioning the element relative to the parent
                <br>The content around it changes its position since its changing its absolute position, its like remove
                the element from previos place and placing it somewhere else,removes element from html flow
            </p>
            <p>
                Fixed<br>
                the position is fixed relative to the body of website
            </p>
            <h4>
                Centering elements with css
            </h4>
            <p style="text-align : center;">
                we can center elements with css, if its only text <br>
                we can do it using property "text-align : center;"
            </p>
            <p style="margin : 0 auto; width : 200px; background-color : #6fbfbf">
                for an element with width we can set left right margins to auto
            </p>
            <h4>
                Fonts
            </h4>
            <p>
                websafe fonts, set of fonts that might be available in all pcs</br>
                <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">fonts.google.com</a> is best thing to get our required type of fonts
                with alternatives.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Font Size
            </h4>
            <p>
                type of sizing units are px, pt, %, em and rem</br>
                16px = 1em = 1rem</br>
                em , rem are dynamic : they change with broser settings</br>
                whereareas px doesn't.</br>
                em and % are inheriting sizes, they will apply parent size along with their own, resulting in wierd
                circustances.</br>
                rem doesnt do that, it keeps the given size , it doesnt get affected by the upstream changes.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Css Float and Clear
            </h4>
            <p>
                Float lets contents float around other content and mainly used to wrap content and text around an image
            </p>
            <p>
                when we use float property and when we want next element below we can use clear property, it can define
                what should happen to an element beside a floating content
            </p>

                </h3>
                <p>Bootstrap is bunch of code that is put into the website that can be reused which helps in styling the website, it was originally developed by twitter.
                    It has predefined styles for our html elements.It also has classes that has been specially styled, we can use them to style our contents.
                    It can be installed using multiple methods
                    <ul>
                        <li>cdn link (browser cashes the bootstrap so we dont have to download again, reduces latency)</li>
                        <li>bootstrap.css file link</li>
                        <li></li>
